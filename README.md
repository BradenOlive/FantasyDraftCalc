## üß† Algorithm Details

### Team Needs Calculation
```javascript
calculateTeamNeeds(team, settings) {
  const needs = {};
  
  // Count current players by position
  const currentCounts = {};
  ['QB', 'RB', 'WR', 'TE', 'K', 'DST'].forEach(pos => {
    currentCounts[pos] = team.roster.filter(p => p.position === pos).length;
  });

  // Calculate needs based on roster requirements
  Object.entries(settings.rosterSpots).forEach(([position, required]) => {
    const current = currentCounts[position] || 0;
    needs[position] = Math.max(0, required - current);
  });

  // Add positional scarcity bonus
  Object.keys(needs).forEach(position => {
    const available = availableByPosition[position] || 0;
    const scarcity = 1.0 / Math.max(1, available);
    needs[position] = needs[position] * (1.0 + scarcity);
  });

  return needs;
}
```

### Value-Based Ranking
```javascript
getValueBasedRankings(availablePlayers, currentRound) {
  const rankings = {};
  
  availablePlayers.forEach(player => {
    let score = player.projectedPoints;
    
    // ADP adjustment (players going later than ADP are better value)
    const adpValue = Math.max(0, player.adp - currentRound);
    score += adpValue * 0.5;
    
    // Tier bonus
    score += player.tier * 10;
    
    // Position scarcity
    const positionScarcity = this.getPositionScarcity(player.position);
    score *= positionScarcity;
    
    rankings[player.id] = score;
  });
  
  return rankings;
}
```

### Player Score Calculation
```javascript
calculatePlayerScore(player, teamNeeds, valueRankings, currentRound) {
  const needScore = teamNeeds[player.position] || 0;
  const valueScore = valueRankings[player.id] || 0;
  
  // Weight team needs more heavily in early rounds, value more in later rounds
  const needWeight = Math.max(0.3, 1.0 - currentRound * 0.05);
  const valueWeight = 1.0 - needWeight;
  
  return (needScore * needWeight) + (valueScore * valueWeight);
}
```
